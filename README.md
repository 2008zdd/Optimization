Optimization
============

Fortran 90 non-linear equations solver with documentation using Brent's method and Powells modified Hybrid method. 


Motivation
----------
There are lot of good books (e.g. Numerical Optimization by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen Wright) for optimization and non linear equations solver. There are also some public domain or open source codes for optimization (e.g. MINPACK in Fortran or Apache Commons for Java). However, it is very hard to connect two. My contribution is providing a usable code with corresponding documentation. Symbols and subroutine structure in the documentaion matches with code. So it is easier to read code. 


What it does
----------
* It solves system of nonlinear equations (hybrid.f90).
* It solves a nonlinear equation with the Brent's method (fzero.f90).
